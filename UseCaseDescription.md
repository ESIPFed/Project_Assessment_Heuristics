## Use Cases:  
The following Use Cases were developed to help scope the research:
*	Use Case 1:  Research Domain Expert
**	I am a domain expert in tropical cyclones and am looking for web-based tools or services to help my research group with certain types of analysis. I am interested in guidance on how to determine if a tool or service will be useful for addressing the research needs of my group.
*	Use Case 2:  Workflow Domain Expert
**	I am a domain expert in tropical cyclones looking for web-based tools or services to help my research group perform certain types of analysis more efficiently and productively without requiring a lot of hands-on training or long ramp-up time. 
*	Use Case 3:  Tool-builder
**	I am a researcher building a tool to provide outcomes from model analyses for tropical cyclone research. I want this tool to be adopted by my research community.  On what kinds of factors or points about my tool should I focus to help me meet that goal?
*	Use Case 4:  AIST Evaluator
**	I am a researcher building a tool to provide outcomes from model analyses for tropical cyclone research. I want this tool to be adopted by my research community.  On what kinds of factors or points about my tool should I focus to help me meet that goal?  

Note that in the course of the research, the Products & Services Committee Chair, and ESIP Staff advised that the use case of most relevance and immediate need was for the Research Domain Expert.  As a result, the Evaluator Checklist has been most fully developed for this use case.  The others have basic questions associated with them, but definitely need more community input and testing.
